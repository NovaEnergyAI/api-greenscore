# Ceramic Demo
A demo of Green Scores using Ceramic & ComposeDB.

### Setup (MacOS)

Start by cloning the repository.

You will have wanted to setup your development environment by following steps [here](https://github.com/internet-development/nextjs-sass-starter/issues/3).

Then run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:10000` in your browser of choice.

Enjoy! The template uses `10000` as our `port` for more compatibility with [Render.com](https://render.com)

### Scripts (Optional)

If you need to run node script without running the server, use this example to get started

```sh
npm run script example
```
